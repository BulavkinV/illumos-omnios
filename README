Last illumos-joyent commit:  bd10f95d113c1cd280d324e137d4b9f1a75fb23e

This is an attempt to port over LX zones into OmniOS.  It's going to be a long,
painful slog, and I don't mean the ZFS kind, either.  :)

An IPS repo that matches public updates of the r151019 bloody repo can be
found at http:/pkg.omniti.com/omnios/LX/.  ipkg and lipkg zones can boot,
appear to be fully functional, but ned more testing.  LX zones can be
installed using ZFS send streams (gzipped or uncompressed) from Joyent's
images.  The "kernel-version" attribute must be set by the administrator to
match the installed image.  For example:

	# zonecfg -z lx0 export
	create -b
	set zonepath=/zones/lx0
	set brand=lx
	set autoboot=false
	set ip-type=exclusive
	add net
	set physical=lx0
	end
	add attr
	set name=kernel-version
	set type=string
	set value=2.6.32
	end
	#

This matches a CentOS 6.8 image from Joyent.  To install the image:

     zoneadm -z lx0 install -s /root/path/to/centos68.gz

You'd obtain the .gz file from Joyent's image servers.

LX zones boot, but with undiagnosed errors in some cases, and one needs to use
/native tools and/or scripts to configure networking on them.  (NOTE:  This
follows the OmniOS adminstrative model for zones.)  LX zones need even more
testing than ipkg/lipkg zones, but appear to at least boot and allow both
"zlogin -C" console logins and "zlogin" direct logins.


I reserve the right to burn this repo to the ground and start fresh.

This repo also has the "joyent" branch, which is a downstream of illumos-joyent.

illumos gate README - Sep 16, 2012.

This is the illumos gate.  This is the illumos source tree.  It contains
the following subdirectories:

	usr/src	- 		The actual source code

	exception_lists	-	These are lists of exceptional cases
				used to limit noise during builds.
				Ideally this directory would consist of
				only empty files.

Integration Rules:

        All changes must have been reviewed, and approved by an advocate
	(below).  A code review may be performed by someone other than the
	advocate, but the final integration should still be approved by the
	advocate. 

        The advocate will want to see your webrev and hg outgoing -v.  The
	advocate will also ask about your testing, and may ask to see your
	build logs.

        All changes must adhere to typical ON style and quality rules.
        For example, pass full cstyle, applicable lint rules, etc.

        All new code must be licensed under CDDL, and modifications to existing
        code may not alter the original license terms.  Integrations of code
        from upstream sources that use another liberal open source license are
        permissible, subject to approval of the advocates or developer council.
        Exceptions to this policy shall require the approval of the developer
        council.

        Commits should have comments of the following form:
