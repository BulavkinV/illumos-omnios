Last illumos-joyent commit:  6a41e7224f5dce21547e07eced881016dac9e18a

This is an attempt to port over LX zones into OmniOS.  It's going to be a long,
painful slog, and I don't mean the ZFS kind, either.  :)

An IPS repo that matches public updates of the r151019 bloody repo can be
found at http:/pkg.omniti.com/omnios/LX/.  ipkg and lipkg zones can boot,
appear to be fully functional, but need more testing.  LX zones can be
installed using ZFS send streams (gzipped or uncompressed) from Joyent's
images, or from tarballs often used for Docker image setup.  The
"kernel-version" attribute must be set by the administrator to match the
installed image.  For example:

	# zonecfg -z lx0 export
	create -b
	set zonepath=/zones/lx0
	set brand=lx
	set autoboot=false
	set ip-type=exclusive
	add net
	set physical=lx0
	end
	add attr
	set name=kernel-version
	set type=string
	set value=2.6.32
	end
	#

This matches a CentOS 6.8 image from Joyent.  To install the image:

     zoneadm -z lx0 install -s /root/path/to/centos68.gz

A tarball install uses the -t flag instead:

     zoneadm -z lx0 install -s /root/path/to/docker-ubuntu.tgz

Effective September 1st, one can use SmartOS-style IP address and DNS
configuration using zonecfg parameters.  Here's the above zone with a pre-
configured set of networking parameters:

	# zonecfg -z lx0 export
	create -b
	set zonepath=/zones/lx0
	set brand=lx
	set autoboot=false
	set ip-type=exclusive
	add net
	set physical=lx0
	add property (name=gateway,value="192.168.0.1")
	add property (name=ips,value="192.168.0.69/24")
	add property (name=primary,value="true")
	end
	add attr
	set name=dns-domain
	set type=string
	set value=example.com
	end
	add attr
	set name=resolvers
	set type=string
	set value=192.168.0.1
	end
	add attr
	set name=kernel-version
	set type=string
	set value=2.6.32
	end
	#

You'd obtain the .gz file from Joyent's image servers.

LX zones boot, and if not configured with zonecfg(1M), one needs to use
/native tools and/or scripts to configure networking on them.  (NOTE:  This
follows the OmniOS adminstrative model for zones.)  LX zones need even more
testing than ipkg/lipkg zones, but appear to at least boot and allow both
"zlogin -C" console logins and "zlogin" direct logins.  Some distros do not
present a console login on the first boot, and the zone may need to be
rebooted

I reserve the right to burn this repo to the ground and start fresh.

This repo also has the "joyent" branch, which is a downstream of illumos-joyent.

illumos gate README - Sep 16, 2012.

This is the illumos gate.  This is the illumos source tree.  It contains
the following subdirectories:

	usr/src	- 		The actual source code

	exception_lists	-	These are lists of exceptional cases
				used to limit noise during builds.
				Ideally this directory would consist of
				only empty files.

Integration Rules:

        All changes must have been reviewed, and approved by an advocate
	(below).  A code review may be performed by someone other than the
	advocate, but the final integration should still be approved by the
	advocate. 

        The advocate will want to see your webrev and hg outgoing -v.  The
	advocate will also ask about your testing, and may ask to see your
	build logs.

        All changes must adhere to typical ON style and quality rules.
        For example, pass full cstyle, applicable lint rules, etc.

        All new code must be licensed under CDDL, and modifications to existing
        code may not alter the original license terms.  Integrations of code
        from upstream sources that use another liberal open source license are
        permissible, subject to approval of the advocates or developer council.
        Exceptions to this policy shall require the approval of the developer
        council.

        Commits should have comments of the following form:

	Each commit must have at least one bug id that is listed in the
